# üöÄ IntelliSys Sales Pitch Notes & Talk Track

## üìã **Quick Pitch Overview (30 seconds)**
*"Most businesses waste 40+ hours per month on repetitive tasks like copying data between Excel and web forms, manual email processing, and desktop data entry. IntelliSys eliminates this waste by automating your ENTIRE desktop - not just browsers. We're talking Excel, Outlook, PDFs, legacy apps - everything. Our clients typically save 20-30 hours per week and see ROI within 30 days."*

## üõ°Ô∏è **Objection Handling**

### **"We already have automation tools"**
- *"That's great! What percentage of your desktop work are they currently automating? Most tools only handle browser tasks - what about Excel, Outlook, PDFs, and legacy applications? IntelliSys fills those gaps."*

### **"It's too expensive"**
- *"I understand cost is a concern. Let's do the math: if this saves each user just 5 hours per week at $30/hour, that's $650/month in value. Our solution pays for itself in the first month and delivers 600% ROI annually."*

### **"We don't have time to implement"**
- *"That's exactly why you need this. Our setup takes 24 hours, not 3 months. And once it's running, you'll save more time in the first week than you spend implementing."*

### **"What about security?"**
- *"Security is our #1 priority. We offer enterprise-grade encryption, on-premise deployment, role-based access controls, and compliance with SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA standards."*

### **"Our team isn't technical enough"**
- *"That's the beauty of IntelliSys - it's designed for non-technical users. The visual workflow builder works like creating a flowchart. Plus, we provide free setup assistance and training."*

### **"We need to think about it"**
- *"I completely understand. While you're thinking, you're losing $[X] daily in productivity. How about we start with a free pilot project? I'll set up one automation for you this week - no cost, no obligation. If it doesn't save you time, we'll part as friends."*

## üéØ **Closing Techniques**

### **Assumptive Close**
- *"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like IntelliSys could save your team 25+ hours per week. Should we start with the Pro plan or would Enterprise features be more appropriate for your organization?"*

### **Urgency Close**
- *"I can get you set up with our limited-time offer - free implementation and premium templates worth $500. But I can only guarantee this pricing through end of month. Should we move forward?"*

### **ROI Close**
- *"You mentioned your team spends 30 hours weekly on manual tasks. At $35/hour, that's $54,000 annually in wasted productivity. Our solution costs $3,600/year and eliminates that waste. When would you like to start saving that $50,000?"*

### **Risk Reversal Close**
- *"I'll tell you what - let's start with a 30-day pilot. If you don't save at least 15 hours per week, I'll refund every penny and personally help you transition off the platform. Fair enough?"*

### **Comparison Close**
- *"You can keep doing things manually and watch competitors gain efficiency, or invest in IntelliSys and become the efficiency leader in your industry. Which future do you prefer?"*

## üìä **Competitive Positioning**

### **vs. UiPath/Blue Prism**
- *"Those are great enterprise RPA tools, but they're complex and expensive. IntelliSys delivers 80% of the value at 20% of the cost and complexity. Perfect for SMBs who need results fast."*

### **vs. Zapier/Microsoft Power Automate**
- *"Those work great for web services, but they can't control your desktop applications. IntelliSys automates Excel, Outlook, PDFs - everything on your actual computer."*

### **vs. Browser-only tools**
- *"Browser automation is just the beginning. What about all the work happening in Excel, desktop apps, PDFs? That's where the real time savings are."*
